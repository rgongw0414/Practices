This paper proposes a method of flower image classification based on the support vector machine
There are three main stages in the method
Perform segmentation on the input flower image and remove the background
Extract several feature sets from the image
Train the classification model by SVM with various combinations of feature sets
The feature sets include color features and texture features The experimental dataset is the flower dataset

In DNA computing many researches focus on those answers of DNA sequences with specific contents or their lengths
For the minimum finding problem with DNA computing considering sequence lengths is not hard because DNA gel electrophoresis can be used to solve the problem
Especially the algorithm for solving the minimum or maximum finding problem for encoded DNA sequence on a specific numeral system has never been proposed in the past 
and our algorithm in this paper is the first one

A special case could happen when finding the head of a given forced path
The head is located at either the bottom wall of a light block or the lower right corner of a dark block
We added an If Then Else condition to the algorithm for handling this special case
Tracing out the resulting sequence without increasing the time and space complexities is also easy

It is true that the example in the previous manuscript is not a counterexample to their formula
However it is still a fact that their algorithm cannot work correctly for the case
We modify the DP formula and give some new real counterexamples to their formula

A path consisting of some edges in D and exactly one
heavy edge will form a valid candidate path for P
The minimum of such paths can be obtained by examining all
heavy edges which can be accomplished in E time
Note that the simplest nested paths are two parallel arcs sharing the
same starting and ending vertices
These two parallel arcs are also two parallel paths

In a valid coloring two neighboring nodes cannot be of the same color
The graph coloring problem is to determine the minimum  number of colors needed to color a given graph
Condition one may be taken as the exclusive property of the coloring problem
In other words the set of nodes with the same color can execute the critical step concurrently since they are not adjacent
Thus the design of a 1-fair alternator system can be transformed into the coloring problem

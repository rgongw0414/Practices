/*
Morris Traversal
TC: O(n), n nodes in the tree
SC: O(n), for storing each node's values
Intuition: 
Instead of using a stack to simulate the recursive call, we can use the Morris Traversal to achieve O(1) space complexity.
We simulate the LVR recursions by pointing the right child of the rightmost node of the curr->left subtree to curr (from the L to the V in LVR).
  * I.e., rightmost->right = curr, we can go back to V when we finish the L part.
The parent of node the subtree is curr
By curr = curr->right; we either arrive at subtree root's right child (R) or subtree root (curr, V) itself.
By curr = curr->left; we arrive at the left subtree if curr (L)
Steps:
1. Initialize curr as root
2. While curr is not NULL
   If curr does not have left child (i.e., the L part is done)
      a) Print currâ€™s data
      b) Go to the right, i.e., curr = curr->right
   Else
      a) Make curr as the right child of the rightmost node in curr's left subtree
      b) Go to this left child, i.e., curr = curr->left
